        <p>As of April 21, 2014, Bao Bao, while still spending a lot of time in the den, enjoys climbing in trees, despite a few falls, where she can be spotted by the still-heavy crowds.
            <br />
            <br />She has grown to like sweet potatoes and fruit-sicles, which Mei (her mother) sometimes helps her finish.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Bao Bao and other Pandas usually live in bamboo forests where they feed on bamboo in central China while in the wild.
            <br />
            <br />They used to live on lower ground, however because so many people started living in those areas, they were pushed out to move to higher ground, in the mountains of China.</p>

                        <p>Pandas like Bao Bao have been endangered for years. This is because their homes have been cleared to build farms and other developments by humans.</p>

                        <p>It is hard to count or to know exactly how many pandas are left in the wild, but the number of them is very small.
                        It is estimated that there are only between
                            <b>1,500</b> and
                            <b>3,000</b> pandas living in the wild.</p>

        <h1>How can we help?</h1>
        <p>Building paths, will connect all of the separate forests that the pandas live in.
            <br />
            <br />To do this, some farmland will have to be returned to nature.
            <br />
            <br />This means, it will be difficult to save the Giant Panda if people don't stop developing.</p>

    <section class="content foot2">
        <h1>What is being done to help?</h1>
        <p>Wildlife reserves have been set up in different parts of China to help pandas such Bao Bao, that ensure the pandas have a home, and are being cared for to make sure they can survive in the wild.
            <br />

            </b>You can help by donating or adopting a panda through the World Wildlife Fund.
